    name
    health
    speed (private)
    strength (private)

Speed and strength should be 3 by default. Health should be 100 by default.

The Ninja class should have the following methods:

    sayName() - This should log that Ninja's name to the console.  -get
    showStats() - This should show the Ninja's Strength and Speed, as well as their health. - get
    drinkSake() - This should add +10 Health to the Ninja -set

Example Outputs

const ninja1 = new Ninja("Hyabusa");
ninja1.sayName();
// -> "My ninja name is Hyabusa!"
ninja1.showStats();
// -> "Name: Hayabusa, Health: 100, Speed: 3, Strength: 3" -->
